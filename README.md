## Project Overview
This project proposes a full-stack web application designed to assist individuals in navigating the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. The economic downturn caused by factors like Brexit and COVID-19 has disrupted supply chains, particularly affecting the UK food sector, leading to significant food price inflation. To address this, the proposed solution is a web-based application that aggregates data on discounted products from major supermarkets, streamlining the process of finding and taking advantage of these deals.

## Aims
1. **Develop a Full-Stack Web Application:** Create a modern, user-friendly web application that extracts and displays up-to-date deals from various supermarkets.

2. **Support Individuals Affected by Economic Constraints:** The platform will help users find discounts on high-quality, healthier food options, reducing the need to rely on unhealthy, low-quality alternatives such as fast food, takeaways, or pre-cooked meals.

3. **Encourage Healthier Eating:** This tool can be utilized by healthcare organizations and food banks to promote healthier diets among communities severely impacted by the rising cost of living. By highlighting discounts, this platform allows users and donators to save money while contributing to a healthier lifestyle.
